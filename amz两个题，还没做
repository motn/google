QUESTION:
Write a function to convert an Integer representing a number of bytes (less than or equal to 1 Gigabyte) into an 
easy to read format, defined as follows:
?  Maximum of 3 digits (not counting a decimal point), and a single letter to signify the unit of measure.
?  No leading zeroes, or trailing zeroes after a decimal point.
?  Be as accurate as possible
341B = 341B
o  34200B = 34.2K
o  5910000B = 5.91M
o  1000000000B = 1G
?  No leading zeroes, or trailing zeroes after a decimal point. Examples:
o  34K, not 034K
o  7.2M, not 7.20M
?  Be as accurate as possible. Example:
o  54123B = 54.1K, not 54K
?  Note: For this problem, 1000 bytes = 1 KB, and so on.
?  Round to the nearest valid values.

A B-tree is a generalization of a binary search tree, where each node has n keys and n+1 children and n
can be different for each node. The keys are sorted the same as in a binary search tree. For each key k in
the tree, all children to the left must have keys less than k, and all children to the right must have keys
greater than k.
QUESTION:
Write a method that validates whether a B-tree is correctly sorted. You do NOT need to validate whether
the tree is balanced. Use the following model for a node in the B-tree.
